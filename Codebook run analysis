The data set "averages.csv" combines data from the following source files:
-'features.txt': List of all features.
- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.
- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 
- 'test/subject_test.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

The data is created in the following order:
First, all "training" files are merged to the corresponding test files.
Variable names are assigned from the features.txt file.
Then the subject, activivity labels and the measurement data sets are merged together.
Finally, only variables containing "mean" or "std" in the variable name are selected.

Next, the data file is melted on activity and subjectID, and then reshaped by casting and aggregating as means.

The variables included in the "averages.csv" data set:
identifiers:

 [1] "activity"                                
 [2] "activitylabel"                           
 [3] "subjectID"   
 
the following variables contain the average measurements per activity and subject:
